# AWS-RAG-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-Project
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using various AWS services. RAG is an AI technique that combines the power of large language models with the ability to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of generated responses.


**AWS Services Used**
**S3DataLoader**: For loading and storing data
**OpenSearch:** For efficient information retrieval
**Amazon Bedrock:** For accessing large language models
**DynamoDB:** For database operations
**SageMaker Studio:** For development and execution environment


**Development Environment
SageMaker Studio Execution Instance**
Image: DataScience 3.0
Kernel: Python 3
Instance: ml.m5.12xlarge (for data loading)

**Key Dependencies**
boto3
sagemaker
requests
requests-aws4auth
unstructured
langchain
langchain-aws
opensearch-py
langchain-community

**Setup Instructions**
Ensure you have the necessary AWS permissions and access to the required services.
Set up a SageMaker Studio environment with the specified image and instance type.
Install the required dependencies using pip:


pip install -U boto3 sagemaker requests requests-aws4auth unstructured langchain langchain-aws opensearch-py langchain-community

**Usage**
Load your data into S3 using the S3DataLoader.
Set up OpenSearch for efficient information retrieval.
Configure Amazon Bedrock to access the desired language models.
Use DynamoDB for any necessary database operations.
Implement your RAG pipeline using the LangChain framework.

**Note**
This project is designed to run in a SageMaker Studio environment. Ensure you have the appropriate AWS configurations and permissions before running the code.
